<nekosune> I have an office chair stalking me!
<Horfius> D:
<Xepoof> how does that work?
<nekosune> I threw out my old chair a good 2 months ago, after a couple days, it disapears, on collection day ... just got back from watching guardians of the galaxy, and we see in a shadowy corner outside the building ... the chair ... angled RIGHT where we parked ...
<Vazkii> And this is how creepypasta starts.

<Vazkii> If you run with shears in your hand, nearby players get damaged.

<The0x539|away> they both have an E
<SpwnX> if she were ginger like him
<Vazkii> ILLUMINATI

<Vazkii> Now I'm tempted to make it so you get warp every time you make a daybloom.
<Vazkii> Because that'd be !!FUN!!

<CaptPanda> lol
<Vazkii> TC4 is dark now.
