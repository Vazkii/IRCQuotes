<nekosune> I have an office chair stalking me!
<Horfius> D:
<Xepoof> how does that work?
<nekosune> I threw out my old chair a good 2 months ago, after a couple days, it disapears, on collection day ... just got back from watching guardians of the galaxy, and we see in a shadowy corner outside the building ... the chair ... angled RIGHT where we parked ...
<Vazkii> And this is how creepypasta starts.

<Vazkii> If you run with shears in your hand, nearby players get damaged.

<CaptPanda> I just added some of the more mainstream magic mods like witchery and blood magic
<Vazkii> The day botania becomes mainstream it instantly loses its purpose :V
<Vazkii> It's a mod for hipsters.
<CaptPanda> I didn't include the likes of TC4 or botania because I do want it darker themed
<CaptPanda> lol
<Vazkii> TC4 is dark now.
<Vazkii> >_>
<Vazkii> I never really got the point of wanting a dark experience. Is your life so amazing that you need to tone it down with depressing shit?
